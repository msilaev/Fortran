# Fortran
This repository contains the Fortran (GNU compilator) and Matlab codes which has been developed for the research project on studying magnetization dynamics in
superconductor/ferromagnet bilayer https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.102.180502
The Fortran code realizes Newton iteration algorithm to solve the system of several dozens coupled non-linear differential equations in 1D to calculate the equilibrium order parameter 
distribution and the spectral functions. 

The Matlab codes solve the linearized non-equilibrium problem: distribution function and corrections to the spectral functions generated by the magnetization dynamics.
The Matlab code "pltresGD.m" produces publication-ready plots.
